# Minesweeper
This is a close-to-perfect clone of the original Minesweeper game with features not limited to flagging, revealing nearby mines, three difficulty options, custom games, and high scores.

The game was programmed by Andrew Luo in Netbeans using Java and the Java Swing library. The game is optimized for 1080p screens, althoug should work on all resolutions. There is no application file, so currently the game only runs on a Java IDE (I've only tested that it works on Netbeans 8.2).
